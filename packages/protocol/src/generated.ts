 * before `cancelled` existed and silently stayed wrong for a round (round-3 finding 3 of the
 * Tier B review) — a second implementor building a parser from it would have omitted a
 * required field. Blocker 1 (Tier B review) is why: summarization is an unbounded provider

 * the next line — measured at 20s, with `abort` itself unanswerable for the duration, which is
 * exactly the availability property REMOTE-CONTROL.md §4[1] refuses to trade ('a host whose
 * whole problem is that τ is producing faster than it can read is precisely the host that
 * needs to abort'). performed=false reports AgentSession.compact() returning None (§1 ground
 * truth) as a real outcome, not an error — an empty conversation, one already ending in a
 * compaction summary, or a cut that would remove no message from the context at all, which
 * under the shipped keep_recent_tokens (20000) is what any smaller conversation gets, so it is
 * this verb's ordinary default-settings answer rather than an edge case; when is_error is
 * true, performed is ABSENT rather than false (a compaction that raised did not 'find nothing
 * to compact'). E5, answered the one way the whole tier answers it (see commands.py 'E5 in
 * Tier B'): `cursor` rides the COMPLETION — the compaction_end notification, where the
 * mutation has genuinely happened — never the acknowledgement, which is built before it has;
 * and it is present on ALL THREE outcomes, the post-compaction tip when performed and the
 * unchanged tip when performed=false or is_error, because absence is not this tier's way of
 * saying 'nothing moved'. custom_instructions, when given, is threaded unchanged to
 * AgentSession.compact. Refusals, all three on THIS response. Two are TURN_STILL_RUNNING
 * (D-1's vocabulary for 'no, a thing is running'): a turn that did not release turn_lock
 * within DEFAULT_SWAP_TIMEOUT_S (the guard is taken in the background task and HELD across the
 * whole compact() call, so a submit() using 'enqueue'/'rollback' cannot interleave with it),
 * and a second compact while one is already in flight — refused immediately, without waiting
 * out the guard, since a compaction holds that lock for as long as the provider takes. The
 * third is D-7 (see commands.py 'DURABILITY in Tier B'): this verb appends a `compaction`
 * entry, so an UNPERSISTED session — the product of new_session {"persist": false} — is
 * refused outright (require_durable_session -> SESSION_NOT_PERSISTED), checked before the
 * single-flight slot is taken and before the provider is paid, and the same answer set_model
 * and set_session_name give. Stated cost, not hidden: compaction is unavailable on an
 * unpersisted session; the fix is to move onto a persisted one. WHERE the entry lands, and for
 * how long (unit S, added at this review's integration — the other two appending verbs said it
 * and this one did not): a --mode rpc process defaults to storing its sessions under a private
 * <tmp>/.tau-<uid>/sessions, NOT the user's ~/.tau/sessions. Most systems clear the temp dir
 * on reboot, so the durability D-7 refuses to promise without is itself bounded by MACHINE
 * UPTIME rather than forever — including the compaction entry and the rewritten tree behind
 * it. A host that needs more must be started with --session-dir DIR (accepted under --mode rpc
 * precisely so a host can choose, including --session-dir ~/.tau/sessions). ABORT (finding 5,
 * Tier B review): a host's `abort` now cancels an in-flight compaction, where it used to
 * answer 'aborted' while the tree was rewritten anyway. The compaction_end that follows
 * carries cancelled=true, no `performed`, and the unchanged cursor; nothing was written,
 * because the summary is generated before the entry is appended. abort's own response names
 * the compaction_id, so the two correlate. Shutdown (D-5, as corrected by finding 3 of the
 * Tier B review, and distinct from the abort above — nobody asked for this one): a compaction
 * still running when the host disconnects is reaped by run()'s teardown, and it reports its
 * outcome EXACTLY ONE of three ways, never none of them. If it finishes while the writer is
 * still alive — which now includes the whole grace period run() gives background tasks,
 * because that reap was moved ahead of the stdout drain — the ordinary compaction_end is
 * delivered. If it finishes after the writer is genuinely gone (broken pipe, or SIGTERM
 * cancelling the writer outright), the full outcome goes to stderr (T4), because a
 * notification nobody can read is not a completion. If it is cancelled before finishing,
 * nothing was written and that too is said on stderr. The hole this closes was real and
 * measured: a compaction completing inside the reap's grace window used to be enqueued onto a
 * queue whose writer had already exited — rc 0, empty stderr, no compaction_end, and a
 * compaction entry durably in the session log for the next process to find unannounced.
 * Discoverability gap, stated not hidden: get_capabilities publishes a params_schema and a
 * result_schema per verb and the event half of the capability document is generated from
 * AgentEvent, so there is no slot in it for a server->client notification's payload.
 * compaction_end's field list is therefore documented here and in
 * commands.COMPACTION_END_PARAMS_SCHEMA (import-time-checked by _assert_supported_schema, like
 * every table schema) rather than published over the wire; widening the capability document to
 * carry notification schemas is a real gap this unit deliberately did not take on. Known gaps,
 * stated not hidden (not fixed by this unit): AgentSession.compact() itself does not acquire
 * turn_lock — the guard closes the race for THIS call only, and any OTHER direct caller (e.g.
 * a future TUI path) remains unprotected; that is AgentSession's debt. compact()'s own
 * agent_start/agent_end bracket (agent_session.py:3119,3123) is emitted via self._events.emit
 * directly, not _emit_stamped, so — same orphan-provenance shape D-4 documents for
 * _maybe_auto_compact — a host correlating events to submission_id sees that pair unstamped;
 * correlate on compaction_end instead. And finding 3 (Tier B review) is only narrowed, not
 * closed: this verb's ACKNOWLEDGEMENT still waits out the D-1 guard on the dispatch path, so a
 * compact sent while a TURN is running still costs the reader up to DEFAULT_SWAP_TIMEOUT_S —
 * bounded, unlike the unbounded case above, and the same bound
 * set_model/set_auto_compaction/set_session_name each pay.

 * than dropping it: a silently shorter list is a list a host would trust. KNOWN GAPS, stated
 * not hidden. (1) The ACTIVE model need not appear here, and this verb does not flag which
 * entry is active: a startup `--model provider/id` is an ad-hoc model with no config key
 * (headless.resolve_model_config), so set_model cannot switch back to it either, and two
 * config names may alias one model id — guessing 'active' by matching get_state's id would be
 * a fabrication where the aliases differ. A host reads get_state for what is running and this
 * for what it may ask for. (2) `context_window` is whatever the resolver returns; today
 * backends.build_model_from_config assigns every config entry the same 128000, including the
 * one get_state reports, so a host must not read a difference into these numbers that the
 * child does not currently make. (3) Nothing here is a capability probe: a name resolving does
 * not mean the endpoint is reachable or the api key is right — set_model's own notes record
 * that a cross-provider switch surfaces a provider auth error on the next turn.

 * against THIS cwd only, so a wider list would advertise ids it would then refuse. (3) A row
 * is metadata, never a promise that loading succeeds — `error` non-null says the entries could

 * MISSING append_model_change entirely is the different, blunter failure it always was —
 * require_log_appender, §1.1, RuntimeError -> INTERNAL_ERROR — because that is a store wired
 * wrong, not a session the host can move off. That refusal is D-7 rule 1, stated once for the
 * whole tier in commands.py's 'DURABILITY in Tier B' block: a verb that APPENDS refuses an
 * unpersisted session — this one, set_session_name, and (since finding 6) compact, which used
 * to run there and report a cursor for an entry that died with the process. Both checks run
 * BEFORE session.set_model(name), so a refusal leaves the in-process model unswitched: this
 * verb never reports 'maybe switched, definitely not persisted'. Known gap (D-2, stated not
 * hidden): the append happens HERE, in the RPC verb, not inside AgentSession.set_model itself
 * — widening that method is out of this phase's scope, since it is also the TUI's own call
 * path — so a TUI model switch still does NOT persist a model_change entry; only a switch made
 * through this RPC verb does. WHERE the entry lands, and for how long (unit S): a --mode rpc
 * process defaults to storing its sessions under a private <tmp>/.tau-<uid>/sessions, NOT the
 * user's ~/.tau/sessions — one 0-message session per spawn would otherwise take over `tau -c`
 * for whoever is working in the same directory. Most systems clear the temp dir on reboot, so
 * this cursor's durability is bounded by MACHINE UPTIME, not forever: a replay can find the
 * entry for the life of the session, and a host that needs more must be started with
 * --session-dir DIR (accepted under --mode rpc precisely so a host can choose, including
 * --session-dir ~/.tau/sessions).

 * `set_session_name` (tier B, since tier-b).

 * D-1 (mutating): takes turn_safety_guard before writing. Reuses
 * extension_types.apply_session_name — the SAME body ExtensionAPI.set_session_name calls
 * (docs/RPC-TIER-B.md B5: 'do not reinvent it and do not copy-paste it'), which itself
 * performs §1.1's raise ('the bound log must have append_session_info, else raise') — so this
 * handler does NOT also call require_log_appender: that would check the identical fact twice.
 * require_log_appender (B0) is for a verb with no pre-existing extension-API body to reuse,
 * e.g. set_model. It DOES take require_durable_session first (Blocker 2, Tier B review), which
 * asks a different question — not 'does the log have the appender' (every real session does)
 * but 'will the entry outlive this process': an unpersisted session (new_session
 * {persist:false}) is refused rather than handed a cursor for a rename nobody will ever read
 * back. That is D-7 rule 1, which commands.py's 'DURABILITY in Tier B' block now states once
 * for the whole tier — this verb appends, so it refuses; `compact` appends too and, since
 * finding 6, gives the same answer instead of a third one. E5, answered the one way the whole
 * tier answers it (see commands.py 'E5 in Tier B'): this response carries the resulting
 * `cursor`, as every Tier B mutator's completion does, present even when the call moved
 * nothing — here the append always moves it. An empty name is INVALID_PARAMS (validate_params
 * has no minLength — see the params schema's own note); an unpersisted session, or a log
 * declaring no durable location (e.g. the SDK's InMemorySessionLog), is SESSION_NOT_PERSISTED
 * — round-3 finding 4 of the Tier B review moved it off INTERNAL_ERROR, which the generated
 * reference defines as 'the handler raised something it did not raise on purpose' and which
 * this refusal is the opposite of. A log MISSING append_session_info altogether still surfaces
 * as INTERNAL_ERROR (require_log_appender): a store wired wrong is not a session the host can
 * move off. Nothing is mutated before either check. Known gap: unlike set_model (D-2), there
 * is no TUI path this duplicates or diverges from — pi's setSessionName has no τ TUI verb yet
 * either, so this is RPC's only door onto append_session_info today. WHERE the rename lands,
 * and for how long (unit S): a --mode rpc process defaults to storing its sessions under a
 * private <tmp>/.tau-<uid>/sessions, NOT the user's ~/.tau/sessions — so a name set here does
 * not show up in that user's TUI picker unless the host was started with --session-dir
 * (accepted under --mode rpc precisely so a host can choose, including --session-dir
 * ~/.tau/sessions). Most systems clear the temp dir on reboot, so this cursor's durability is
 * bounded by MACHINE UPTIME, not forever.
